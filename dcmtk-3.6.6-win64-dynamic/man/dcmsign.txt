NAME
       dcmsign - Sign and Verify DICOM Files


SYNOPSIS
       dcmsign [options] dcmfile-in [dcmfile-out]

DESCRIPTION
       The dcmsign utility reads a DICOM file (dcmfile-in), performs a digital
       signature operation and, if any modification has  taken  place,  writes
       the DICOM object to an output file (dcmfile-out).

       Five digital signature operations are supported:

        verification of all signatures in the DICOM file
        creation of a new digital signature located in the main dataset,
        creation of a new digital signature in an item of a sequence embedded
         within the dataset,
        removal of a single digital signature from the DICOM file, and
        removal of all digital signatures from the DICOM file.
PARAMETERS

NOTES
   Files and Parameters
       The dcmsign utility reads and writes a number of files and file formats
       which are described in this section.
       Public Key Certificates are expected in X.509v3 format, either with PEM
       or DER encoding. The dcmsign utility currently  supports  RSA  and  DSA
       public  keys,  although  only  RSA  keys  are  defines  in the Security
       Profiles of the DICOM standard.
       Private Keys are expected in PEM or DER encoding.  PEM  is  recommended
       (and default) because this allows one to keep private keys in encrypted
       form. Command line options control the  behavior  of  dcmsign  when  an
       encrypted  PEM  key  is  opened  (see  above).  In  general  it  is not
       recommended to specify the encryption  password  in  the  command  line
       because  the  command  line  may  be  visible to other processes in the
       system, e.g. 'ps -ef'.
       By default, dcmsign will create a signature covering all data  elements
       in  the  dataset  or item. This default can be overridden by explicitly
       specifying a list of data elements  (attribute  tags).  This  list  can
       either be read from a file or specified on the command line or both (in
       this case the attribute tags are combined).
       On the command line, attribute tags are specified as
       --tag "gggg,eeee"  where gggg and eeee are the hexadecimal group
                          and element numbers
       --tag "Name"       where 'Name' is a symbolic attribute name from
                          the DICOM dictionary (see below).
       When attribute tags are read from file with the  --tag-file  option,  a
       plain  text  file is expected. Tags within the file are either symbolic
       names from the data dictionary or have  the  format  (gggg,eeee)  (with
       braces). Tags are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
       The currently selected digital signature profile may specify additional
       attribute tags required to be included in the signature, which will  be
       silently added.
       The  --sign-item operation requires a location string that describes in
       which sequence item a signature is to be created. The  location  string
       has the following format:
       SequenceName[index].SequenceName[index].SequenceName[index](...)
       where  SequenceName  is  either a symbolic attribute name from the data
       dictionary or a numeric tag in the format (gggg,eeee) and index  is  an
       unsigned  decimal  integer  for the item number, starting with zero for
       the first item in a sequence. As an  example,  the  following  location
       string
       ReferencedSeriesSequence[0].ReferencedImageSequence[1]
       would cause a digital signature to be created in the second item of the
       ReferencedImageSequence (0008,1140) which is located in the first  item
       of  the  ReferencedSeriesSequence  (0008,1115)  which is located in the
       main DICOM dataset.
   Certified Timestamps
       Starting with release  3.6.6,  dcmsign  offers  support  for  certified
       timestamps  according to RFC 3161. For now, the tool does not implement
       any of the network protocols defined in RFC 3161 for communicating with
       a  timestamp  authority (TSA), but it can write a timestamp query (TSQ)
       during signature creation, and the new command --insert-timestamp  will
       read  a  timestamp  response  (TSR)  from  file and add it to the DICOM
       digital signature. Since a DICOM file can contain multiple  signatures,
       a  'UID  file'  (which  contains  the Digital Signature UID) is used to
       identify the signature to which the TSR should be  added.  The  dcmsign
       tool  will  also  perform various consistency checks before storing the
       timestamp.
       During signature verification, the presence of  a  certified  timestamp
       will  be detected and the timestamp will also be verified unless option
       --ignore-ts was used. Signature verification and timestamp verification
       use  a  common certificate store to check the certificates of the DICOM
       signature and the timestamp. This  store  can  be  populated  with  the
       options  --add-cert-file  and --add-cert-dir, which both add trusted CA
       certificates, --add-ucert-file, which adds an untrusted intermediate CA
       certificate,  and  --add-crl-file,  which adds a certificate revocation
       list.
   Hashed Certificate Directories
       Instead of adding CA  certificates  and  certificate  revocation  lists
       (CRLs)  manually using --add-cert-file and --add-crl-file, the user can
       set-up a directory where dcmsign will look-up and load certificates and
       CRLs from as needed, using --add-cert-dir.
       Th  directory  should  contain  one  certificate or CRL per file in PEM
       format, with a filename of  the  form  hash.N  for  a  certificate,  or
       hash.rN for a CRL. The hash is the value returned by
       openssl  x509  -hash  -noout  -in  <filename.pem>  (for  a certificate)
       openssl crl -hash -noout -in <filename.pem> (for a CRL)
       The .N or .rN suffix is a sequence number that starts at zero,  and  is
       incremented  consecutively  for  each  certificate or CRL with the same
       hash value. Gaps in the sequence  numbers  are  not  supported,  it  is
       assumed  that  there  are no more objects with the same hash beyond the
       first missing number in the sequence.
       CRLs will only be verified when option --enable-crl-vfy  is  specified.
       In  this  case, dcmsign will expect a CRL to be present for each CA and
       will fail signature verification if no CRL can be found for the CA that
       issued the signer certificate.
LOGGING
       The  level  of  logging  output  of  the various command line tools and
       underlying libraries can be specified by the  user.  By  default,  only
       errors  and  warnings  are  written to the standard error stream. Using
       option --verbose also informational messages  like  processing  details
       are  reported.  Option  --debug  can be used to get more details on the
       internal activity, e.g. for debugging purposes.  Other  logging  levels
       can  be  selected  using option --log-level. In --quiet mode only fatal
       errors are reported. In such very severe error events, the  application
       will  usually  terminate.  For  more  details  on the different logging
       levels, see documentation of module 'oflog'.
       In case the logging output should be written to file  (optionally  with
       logfile  rotation),  to syslog (Unix) or the event log (Windows) option
       --log-config can be used.  This  configuration  file  also  allows  for
       directing  only  certain messages to a particular output stream and for
       filtering certain messages based on the  module  or  application  where
       they  are  generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is provided in
       <etcdir>/logger.cfg.
COMMAND LINE
       All command line tools  use  the  following  notation  for  parameters:
       square  brackets  enclose  optional  values  (0-1), three trailing dots
       indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of  both
       means 0 to n values.
       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+'
       or '-' sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command  line
       options  are  arbitrary  (i.e.  they  can appear anywhere). However, if
       options are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is  used.  This
       behavior  conforms  to  the  standard  evaluation  rules of common Unix
       shells.
       In addition, one or more command files can be specified  using  an  '@'
       sign  as  a  prefix to the filename (e.g. @command.txt). Such a command
       argument is replaced by the content  of  the  corresponding  text  file
       (multiple  whitespaces  are  treated  as a single separator unless they
       appear between two quotation marks) prior to  any  further  evaluation.
       Please  note  that  a command file cannot contain another command file.
       This simple but effective  approach  allows  one  to  summarize  common
       combinations  of  options/parameters  and  avoids longish and confusing
       command lines (an example is provided in file <datadir>/dumppat.txt).
EXIT CODES
       The dcmsign utility uses the following  exit  codes  when  terminating.
       This  enables  the  user  to  check  for the reason why the application
       terminated.

ENVIRONMENT
       The dcmsign utility  will  attempt  to  load  DICOM  data  dictionaries
       specified  in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable. By default, i.e. if
       the  DCMDICTPATH  environment   variable   is   not   set,   the   file
       <datadir>/dicom.dic  will be loaded unless the dictionary is built into
       the application (default for Windows).
       The  default  behavior  should  be  preferred   and   the   DCMDICTPATH
       environment  variable  only used when alternative data dictionaries are
       required. The DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same  format  as
       the  Unix  shell PATH variable in that a colon (':') separates entries.
       On Windows systems, a semicolon (';') is used as a separator. The  data
       dictionary  code  will  attempt  to  load  each  file  specified in the
       DCMDICTPATH environment variable. It is an error if no data  dictionary
       can be loaded.
